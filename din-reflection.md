**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

*I struggled most with undoing a Git init on a subfolder! I worked with my teacher earlier this week to undo the mistake I made and I can't even remember the commands we used, but somehow it worked. **

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

*I had never resolved a merge conflict before, so this exercise was a good intro to it. We worked through it by trying to make the mistake "correctly" so we could resolve it. We discovered that a merge conflict happens when you are trying to make a change to the same file without proper git workflow.*

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

*I asked a lot of logistical questions in the beginning, since it was our first GPS. It was the second time I did a clone repo, so I asked my guide questions about that as well.*

**What still confuses you about Git?**

*Undoing a git init in a subfolder.*

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

*It took us three hours! :) My pair was very nice and open to suggestions. And I didn't mind the time going by, because I learned a lot.*
